# Code Review: Exercise 1 Findings

## General Observations
- Describe overall impressions of the codebase.
- Highlight any immediate concerns with the structure or design.

## Identified Issues
### 1. Long Methods
- Example: `<MethodName>` in `<FileName>` has X lines and performs multiple tasks.

### 2. Lack of Abstractions
- Example: The `<ClassName>` class in `<FileName>` has overlapping responsibilities such as managing game state and handling user input.

### 3. Code Duplication
- Example: Similar code snippets found in `<FileName:LineNumber>` and `<FileName:LineNumber>`. Suggest consolidating these into a reusable method.

### 4. Naming Conventions
- Example: Variable `<VariableName>` in `<FileName:LineNumber>` is ambiguous and does not clearly describe its purpose.

### 5. Other Violations
- Example: `<IssueDescription>` in `<FileName:LineNumber>` impacts code readability/maintainability.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- Provide high-level recommendations for improving code quality.
- Suggest refactoring strategies or design changes.

## Conclusion
- Summarize your findings and their potential impact on maintainability and readability.
