# Exercise 1: Code Rot and Refactoring

## Objective
Understand code smells and their impact on maintainability by reviewing the provided Blackjack codebase.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository or download the files into your local environment.
2. Navigate to the `src/` folder where the Blackjack codebase is located.
3. Perform a code review by examining:
   - Long methods
   - Lack of abstractions
   - Code duplication
   - Violations of clean code principles

4. Document your findings in the `code_review.md` file.

## Deliverables
- Complete the `code_review.md` file in this directory with your observations.
- Ensure your findings are detailed and focus on specific issues in the codebase.

---

## Questions to Consider During Review
- Are methods or functions too long and trying to do too much?
- Is there unnecessary repetition of code (code duplication)?
- Do classes or methods have unclear or overlapping responsibilities?
- Is the naming of variables and methods clear and meaningful?
- Are there any areas where abstraction or encapsulation can improve the design?

---

## Outcome
After completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Identify common code smells.
- Understand how these issues impact maintainability.
- Document code quality problems effectively.
